# Tic Tac Toe
- The game is to be played between two people (in this program between two HUMANS).
- One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
- The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
- If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
