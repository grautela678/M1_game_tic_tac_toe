# INTRODUCTION
## Welcome to the tic_tac_toe game.
- The game is to be played between two people (in this program between two HUMANS).
- One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
- The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
- If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.

# RESEARCH
- Alexander Sandy Douglas' thesis was a success, earning him his Ph.D. and starting his career in science, however, he would never again program another video or computer game.
- Although OXO was the very first video/computer game, it was almost completely overlooked at the time. There was only one EDSAC computer in existence, which was housed at the University of Cambridge and never made accessible to the public.
- The code for OXO was retained as a tech demo for the EDSAC's capabilities.
# FEATURES
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

- You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
